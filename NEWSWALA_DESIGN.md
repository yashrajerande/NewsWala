## 1. What Is NewsWala?

NewsWala is a personal AI-powered daily news digest system built for a family.

Every morning it automatically:
- Scans the internet for the best news from Economics, Science & Technology, and India Current Affairs
- Filters and rewrites the news in language suitable for children aged 11 and 18
- Composes a short, warm WhatsApp-ready message from both parents
- Creates an image prompt featuring the family's cocker spaniel as a memory cue
- Delivers everything to Telegram so it's ready to copy-paste into WhatsApp

---

## 2. Family Context

| Person | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Yash | Parent / Owner | Co-author of all messages |
| Pooja | Parent | Co-author of all messages |
| Manishka | Elder daughter | Turning 18 on 24 October — can handle nuance and complexity |
| Divyana | Younger daughter | Turning 11 on 12 July — needs warmth, clarity, simplicity |
| Caramel | Cocker Spaniel Family pet | Always appears in the daily image as a memory cue |

**Sign-off on every message:** *Love, Mama & Papa*

---

## 3. What Problem Does It Solve?

Yash and Pooja want to share interesting, educational news with their daughters every day on WhatsApp. But:

- Finding good stories takes time
- Rewriting them for children takes skill
- Doing it consistently every single day is hard
- The message needs to feel personal, not copy-pasted from a news site

NewsWala automates all of this while keeping the human, family feel.

---

## 4. System Architecture

NewsWala is a **multi-agent pipeline** — six specialised AI agents that work together like a small newsroom team.

## 5. The Six Agents

### Agent 1 — news_scout
**Role:** Searches the internet for today's best stories

- Uses Claude's live web search tool to scan the internet in real time
- Looks across Economics, STEM, and India Current Affairs
- Finds 4–6 candidate stories from credible sources
- Scores each story on: credibility, novelty, inspiration, educational value, India relevance, child suitability, memorability, and lesson potential
- Prefers sources like Reuters, BBC, The Hindu, Mint, ISRO, Nature, Financial Times

**Avoids:** Celebrity gossip, crime, graphic content, partisan politics, clickbait

---

### Agent 2 — family_fit_editor
**Role:** Picks the best stories for this specific family

- Reviews all candidate stories from news_scout
- Evaluates each one for age-appropriateness, emotional safety, educational value, and lesson potential
- Selects the best **1 story** (or at most **2** if two are exceptional)
- Rejects anything too dark, too political, or too trivial
- Adds family-specific notes explaining why each story was chosen

---

### Agent 3 — whatsapp_copywriter
**Role:** Writes the message Yash and Pooja send to their daughters

- Writes in the voice of both parents together — warm, intelligent, modern Indian family
- Keeps it short enough to read in 30 seconds
- Includes a catchy opening, the story in simple language, and a memorable lesson line
- Adds an optional thought-prompt question to spark conversation
- Signs off: *Love, Mama & Papa*
- Works for both an 11-year-old and an 18-year-old at the same time

**Style rules:** No babyish tone. No preaching. No excessive emojis. No fake facts. No motivational clichés.

---

### Agent 4 — memory_cue_designer
**Role:** Designs an image concept to help the daughters remember the story

- Always features the family's **cocker spaniel** doing something connected to the story
- Creates a charming, whimsical visual mnemonic
- Examples:
  - Space story → cocker spaniel in a mini astronaut helmet pointing at a rocket
  - Economics story → cocker spaniel arranging coins into a rising bar graph
  - Indian science breakthrough → cocker spaniel in a lab coat next to a glowing invention

---

### Agent 5 — image_maker
**Role:** Turns the image concept into a ready-to-use image generation prompt

- Writes a detailed prompt for DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion
- Square format (WhatsApp-friendly)

- Handles errors and retries at each step
- Validates the output against quality checks
- Delivers the final package to Telegram

```
